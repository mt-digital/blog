<!-- Human beings, by necessity, are all social scientists, at least in an informal way. This is because most people cannot survive without social exchange. We evolved powerful skills for  is complex, meaning there are many constituent causal agents and correlated processes involved. We human beings are also unique in both in our ability to predict outcomes from sets of combinations of rich actions, each composed of more basic actions, in an uncertain world. Nearly every person alive, on most days, needs to be able to predict how their behavior will influence others in order to get our needs met. Oftentimes this is simple: just pay the cashier for what you want, and you get to take home your goods without incident; choose to leave the store without paying and you may earn yourself a court date. Other times it is more complicated, for instance if you are trying to decide who are the most important people to target with health interventions around culturally sensitive topics, such as trying to stop female genital cutting in a culture where there are strong gender norms for doing so [@Vogt2016]. This necessity for predicting the outcome of social behavior may even provide the foundation for conscious awareness, planning, and ethics [@DennettFreedomEvolves2023, Ch. 8]. -->

I think of myself as a theoretical social scientist, in the same sense as a theoretical physicist, chemist, or biologist. Unfortunately that does not seem to be a title that social scientists use or recognize. Other major scientific fields separate theoretical and empirical practitioners, including biology, chemistry and physics. If a *biologist*, let's say, primarily develops and analyzes simplified, abstract models of biological phenomena, they would probably be called a *theoretical biologist* (or perhaps *mathematical biologist*). Same if we replace *biologist* with *physicist* or *chemist*. Theoretical scientists try to explain wide varieties of scientific results with minimal assumptions, a quality called parsimony. A more parsimonious theory explains more empirical phenomena with fewer assumptions. The job of theoretical scientists is to increase the parsimony of their field's theories, fostering synergy between new theoretical and empirical work and attempting to avoid fractured foundational knowledge. I want to take a few paragraphs to understand how this works in social science and to answer, what, exactly, is the job of a theoretical social scientist?

Theoretical specialists can help ensure that social science research is motivated by mechanistic models that are both logically self-consistent and consistent with accepted theory. Mechanistic models of social behavior specify the capacities that model agents have and how they interact with one another and their environment. Capacities and interaction tend to be specified in terms of parameters, e.g., a parameter that says how likely an agent is to learn from someone else at a certain time step. This combination of parameterized capacities and interactions that results in complex social behavior of interest can be represented by a set of equations that simulates certain model dynamics, or implemented as a generative simulation. Simulations can be run over model parameters for furthermore that yield clear predictions generated through the simulation machine defined by the mechanistic model. This will help avoid over-generalization of empirical results that can occur when non-mechanistic verbal descriptions of previous correlations theoretically motivate the research [@Yarkoni2022]. To make models most useful for predicting real-world outcomes, theorists must be able to justify and unpack modeling choices. For example, if one adopts a model of cultural evolution, one must define "mutation" and explain how cultural "generations" relate to genetic generations for which the concept of mutation was first defined.

Currently, it is not clear how well I, or theoretical social science in general, is doing at providing parsimonious explanations of empirical phenomena. Oftentimes models are narrowly focused on phenomenon in a specific context or they are focused on generating phenomena that may be difficult to directly reproduce in a laboratory.

Theoretical scientists find common cause with their empiricist colleagues in a division of labor meant to maximize the productivity of individuals and the field as a whole. Richard Feynman, an influential theoretical physicist, had a special skill for asking helpful questions of experimentalist colleagues that helped them debug experimental apparatuses that were not operating properly. Currently the social sciences seem to proceed from fractured, inharmonious theoretical foundations [@Almaatouq2022]. Perhaps by clearly delineating theoretical and experimental practices of social science, individuals can better develop and harness critical expertise through this division of labor. Theoretical social scientists could help, for example, engage with experimental social scientists, visit anthropological field sites, and get involved with designing experiments or fieldwork. This will help us build a sound, not fractured, theoretical foundation for a rigorous understanding of social science in general.

<!-- However, the current efforts towards building more rigorous social science theories began when there was another kind of social theory, in the tradition of Foucault and Lacan, who do try to understand why things are how they are, but they do it without mathematics or any kind of formalized mechanistic model.  -->

<!-- I believe I don't know why this is, but perhaps it is the human condition to theorize about social behavior in order to predict how different options for one's social behavior will play out in order to survive and thrive, i.e., to optimize the outcomes of one's social behavior. -->

<!-- Am I characterizing the split properly between empirical and theoretical work in social science? Does your work span both fields? Do you think it makes sense and may be beneficial to more clearly recognize, or even encourage,  differences in training and expertise between theoretical and empirical social scientists? Please discuss with me below! -->
