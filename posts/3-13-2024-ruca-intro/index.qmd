Our current epoch is characterized by threats of climate change, ecosystem loss, pandemics, political and social instability, and more. In response, we humans are challenged to collectively develop adaptations that mitigate or prevent greater catastrophe [@PisorLansingMagargal2023; @Currie2024]. Collective adaptation is an emergent phenomena composed of constituent sub-processes occurring across several time, population, and geographic/spatial scales: from milliseconds to millenia; from an individual to dyads to the global metapopulation; and from micrometers-long neurons to global-scale communication networks [@GalesicEtAl2023]. If we can develop a rigorous understanding of how collective adaptation works, we may be better able to optimize "stewardship of global collective behavior" [@Bak-Coleman2021] using social science.

Non-human populations, from viruses to whales, also co-adapt and co-evolve. Pathogen evolution is important cases due to the risk of disease outbreaks when pathogens spill over from non-human animals (e.g., birds, bats, pigs) to humans. Spillovers are increasingly common in the new epoch of rapid global change [@Baker2022]. In spillovers, pathogens are initially poorly adapted to their new human hosts, but can rescue themselves through evolution [@Visher2021]. Pathogen evolution is sensitive to metapopulation group structure [@Best2011], and therefore pathogen evolution may be sensitive to changes in human group size, asymmetric homophily levels, out-group aversion, and rising extremism and polarization. If we can predict which groups are most likely to get infected, and which individuals are best to target for intervention towards pandemic preparedness behaviors (such as getting vaccinated), we could more efficiently use available resources. In addition to such practical applications of studying collective adaptation, we can better understand what we share with other species such as whales, who collectively generate a cumulative cultural repertoire of whale songs possibly used for courtship [@Garland2022].

## How to contribute to a rigorous understanding of collective adaptation?

Rigor takes time. To promote rigor is to promote a stepwise approach to building up an understanding of which parts of a system interact, and how, to cause the emergence of higher-order processes constituted by those interactions. This approach can be called *mechanistic modeling*. Mechanistic models are useful for emergent phenomena such as collective adaptation because they force experimenters to explicitly state what are the component parts of their system of interest [@Kauffman1970] and how do they interact to produce some process composed of numerous such interactions [@Craver2006].

## My contributions to the rigorous understanding of collective adaptation

My work centers on developing mechanistic models that synthesize and clarify potentially diverse modeling assumptions and understand the sometimes unexpected consequences of model assumptions [@Turner2022]. I am in the process of theoretically connecting different strands of work in my research program---in fact one reason this blog exists is to motivate me to develop theoretical connections between my recent work and provide a platform for publishing the first draft versions of this theoretical map. [@Turner2023] on diffusion of adaptations in metapopulations with asymmetric group-level homophily; but how would different forms of ecological uncertainty in predicting behavioral payoffs [@Turner2023a] affect the diffusion of adaptive behaviors? What about when individuals can share and disagree about beliefs or opinions, in addition to influencing one another's behavioral knowledge through social learning? We know that initial beliefs, miscommunication, and random chance increase extremism and polarization to different degrees in different network structures [@Turner2018]. This may drive individuals to become more entrenched in their beliefs, which may pull politically centrist individuals into more extreme opinions [@Turner2020].

For my work on pandemic preparedness, I need this nascent theoretical system in order to understand how pathogens evolve in metapopulatuions with asymmetric group-level homophily that were studied in the context of adaptation diffusion in @Turner2023.
