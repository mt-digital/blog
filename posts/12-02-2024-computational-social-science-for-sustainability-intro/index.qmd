## Introduction

Sustainable human thriving is threatened by aggregated behavioral choices that
have resulted in anthropogenic climate change and
rapid ecosystem degredation. This further inflames political and
social instability and increases the risk of, and uncertainty around,
climatic disasters, pandemics and other catastrophes. 

Ostrom's design principles...

To study social dynamics and sustainability we recombine existing scientific
methodologies to synthesize new, practical social scientific theories
[@Fodor1974; @Feyerabend2010].
Computational social science provides tools to rigorously understand human 
behavior, can help reduce risk and uncertainty to "steward[]...global collective
behavior" towards more equitable, prosperous, and sustainable equilibria
[@Bak-Coleman2021]. The challenges of designing sustainable 

Before too much abstraction, though, let's evaluate an example of a common
dilemma for individuals when making choices about sustainabile behaviors: the
decision of whether to participate in _reducing deforestation and land
degradation_, especially _in the developing world_ (REDD+ is the common acronymn). 

### Example sustainability dilemmas

In the California Central Valley, groundwater drawdown is causing the earth to
sink and is most immediately degrading the water supply for 
historically-disadvantaged rural communities. The Sustainable Groundwater
Management Act (SGMA) limits groundwater extractions, but enforcement may be ) 

If rewards are given at the community level, then one may be tempted not to
cooperate, or to _free ride_, i.e., to reap benefits of collective action
without participating. In general, whether or not we contribute 

Many factors contribute to making this decision; we'll focus on game theoretic
factors; other factors to consider can be summarized as _individual and social learning_ and
_social influence_, and the resulting _opinion dynamics_.

Here we will show two simple examples of studying why people do or do not 
cooperate with one another. _R_ code snippets are provided along with the 
widgets that display the models.

Sustainable behaviors often require some sort of cooperation to achieve a
critical mass of participation necessary for real change. If only a few nations,
corporations, or individuals commit to and perform greenhouse gas reduction, 
no meaningful progress will be made. In the case of REDD+ interventions, 
deforestation will not be significantly reduced if only a few farmers
participate. If we assume people are self-interested and rational, under what
conditions do groups cooperate? 

In the next two sections, I introduce two models of cooperation that have been
used to answer this question. One is based on cooperation _games_ played by
two agents at a time. 


## The sustainability (prisoners') dilemma: cooperate?

```{r}
nagents <- 6
# Symbols from 
alpha <- 0
beta <- 3
gamma <- 1

payoff_matrix <- 
network <- "complete"
model <- GameModel$new(nagents) 
```


## Contribute or freeride? That depends...

In sustainability dilemmas contribute somewhat anonymously to our group's 
finances to achieve shared goals.

## Conclusion

We saw two models of .

All scientific models must decide at which joints to cut nature, Some call this
violence done to nature, focusing on the carnal features of this butchering
metaphor. Scientific carving, however, is not done with long, sharp, heavy
knives, but by hypothetically eliminating variability in some potentially
important social dynamics to extract theoretical meat in the form of a deeper
understanding of other social dynamics that could be affected by, but do not
require, dynamical input from other important processes. Furthermore, it is
significantly more arbitrary where the joints really are, especially in inexact
behavioral and social sciences [@Fodor1974].  Slater and Borghini quote Plato,
"...like an animal, the world comes to us predivided" and that  [@Slater2011].
In more exact sciences like physics, chemistry, and even ecology, it may be
easier to perceive these divisions phenomena. In those sciences, nature seems
predivided as electrons, protons, neutrons, which combine to form the elements
and molecules.  In the relatively more complex and uncertain science of ecology,
species are defined as groups whose members can mate with one another, but not
with members of other groups. In less exact sciences of behavioral and social
systems, with greater intrinsic uncertainty and complexity, it is important
to understand that people, their behaviors, and their environment are the 


In the examples above, we made some implicit assumptions about behavioral and
social dynamics that could theoretically 

the world that maximize the amount of theoretical meat extracted from a minimum
amount of cuts. These assumptions

is to identify one essential interaction between two to $N$ agents that

<!-- Collective
adaptation is an emergent phenomena composed of constituent sub-processes
occurring across several time, population, and geographic/spatial scales: from
milliseconds to millenia; from an individual to dyads to the global
metapopulation; and from micrometers-long neurons to global-scale communication
networks [@GalesicEtAl2023]. If we can develop a rigorous understanding of how
collective adaptation works, we may be better able to optimize "stewardship of
global collective behavior" [@Bak-Coleman2021]. Modern stewardship of collective
behavior at all population scales needs the scientific, rigorous understanding
olossf collective adaptation we contribute to in the RUCA project.

![Sketch of collective human and non-human collective adaptation. Novel technologies and threats both emerge from human cultural evolution. Pandemic-causing pathogens, biodiversity, and human culture all co-evolve on commensurate time scales.](image.jpg){width="50%"}

Non-human populations, from viruses to whales, also co-adapt and co-evolve. Pathogen evolution is important cases due to the risk of disease outbreaks when pathogens spill over from non-human animals (e.g., birds, bats, pigs) to humans. Spillovers are increasingly common in the new epoch of rapid global change [@Baker2022]. In spillovers, pathogens are initially poorly adapted to their new human hosts, but can rescue themselves through evolution [@Visher2021]. Pathogen evolution is sensitive to metapopulation group structure [@Best2011], and therefore pathogen evolution may be sensitive to changes in human group size, asymmetric homophily levels, out-group aversion, and rising extremism and polarization. If we could predict which groups are most likely to get infected, and which individuals are best to target for intervention towards pandemic preparedness behaviors (such as getting vaccinated), we could more efficiently use available resources.

Beyond applications to critical problems, collective adaptation theory can be used to better understand culture in other species, for example whales who collectively generate, through transmission and modulation, a cumulative cultural repertoire of whale songs [@Garland2022].

## The RUCA approach

Rigor takes time, following a step-wise approach to understand which parts of a
system interact, and how, to cause the emergence of higher-order processes
constituted by those interactions. This is known as *mechanistic modeling*
[@Turner2022]. Mechanistic models are useful for emergent phenomena such as
collective adaptation because they force experimenters to explicitly state what
are the component parts of their system of interest [@Kauffman1970] and how do
they interact to produce some process composed of numerous such interactions
[@Craver2006]. My work develops mechanistic models that synthesize, connect, and
clarify diverse adaptive and social processes and understand the sometimes
unexpected consequences of the interaction of these processes and the
environment [@Turner2018; @Turner2020; @Turner2023a; @Turner2023]. -->
