See [@Kossinets2009;@Centola2010;@Centola2011] for some modern model and empirical foundations. @Evtushenko2021 define first- and second-order homophily of a node: first-order homophily is "individual tendency to link to similar others" and second-order homophily is "aggregate first-order homophily of its neighbors". 

Not sure what to do here, but I think this will be valuable.
