See [@Kossinets2009; @Centola2010; @Centola2011] for some modern model and empirical foundations. @Evtushenko2021 define first- and second-order homophily of a node: first-order homophily is "individual tendency to link to similar others" and second-order homophily is "aggregate first-order homophily of its neighbors".

Mixing in modern contexts, e.g., Pew data on friendships [@PewMultiracial2015]. Jobs from home versus frontline/essential varies by cities, races [@Dingel2020]. Not sure what to do here, but I think this will be valuable.

Homophily could be invisible or not. For instance, experimenters could put people into groups with different homophily values, but it would be invisible without group markers. Could try to have different conditions that reveal group membership to see if knowledge of group membership inhibits diffusion of adaptations. Could probably do different things to increase animosity towards the out-group, but not sure what just yet.
