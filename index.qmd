### Pursuing a rigorous understanding of collective adaptation {#labname}

Hello and welcome! I am obsessed with contributing to the emerging science of understanding how populations of humans and non-humans alike collectively adapt to their environment through social influence and evolution. I develop mechanistic models of various processes that contribute to collective adaptation that are often implemented as agent-based models, but also evaluated formally and using generative modeling. On this site you can read my blog presenting research notes on developing a [rigorous understanding (RUCA) blog](blog.qmd) or find more information about my work by reviewing my recent papers listed below or in my [CV](static/turner_cv.pdf).

I am currently a [Pandemic Preparedness Postdoctoral Scholar]() working in [James Holland Jones' Human Evolutionary Ecology and Health](https://heeh.stanford.edu/about/james-holland-jones) group in the Social Sciences Division of the Stanford Doerr School of Sustainability at Stanford University. I received my PhD in Cognitive and Information Sciences from the University of California, Merced. I have an MS degree in Applied Physics from Rice University, and a dual BS degree in Mathematics and Physics from Syracuse University. I worked professionally in Moscow, Idaho, as a data engineer at an economic modeling firm and then as a lead research software developer at the University of Idaho working on a multi-state  (Idaho, Nevada, New Mexico) collaborative model- and data-intensive hydrology project.
