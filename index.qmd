# Matthew Adam Turner, PhD {#name}

## Director of the Rigorous Understanding of Collective Adaptation (RUCA) Project {#title}

### Current role

I am currently a [Pandemic Preparedness Postdoctoral Scholar](https://pandemichub.stanford.edu/fellows/) working in [James Holland Jones' Human Evolutionary Ecology and Health](https://heeh.stanford.edu/about/james-holland-jones) group in the Social Sciences Division of the Stanford Doerr School of Sustainability at Stanford University. I will soon develop and teach undergraduate and graduate courses in computational social science for sustainability as a Lecturer, beginning November 2024 at the Stanford Doerr School of Sustainability. 
<!-- I direct the Rigorous Understanding of Collective Adaptation (RUCA) project, explained below. -->

### Pursuing a rigorous understanding of collective adaptation

Climate disaster mitigation and pandemic preparedness need a science of collective adaptation to make wise policy. To meet this need, the **r**igorous **u**nderstanding of **c**ollective **a**daptation (RUCA) project studies how populations of individuals collectively adapt to their social and physical environment through exploratory learning and innovation, social influence, and evolution. The RUCA project develops mechanistic models of how collective adaptation emerges from repeated social interactions within social networks and variable, uncertain environments. Computational mechanistic models allow us to analyze and predict the efficacy of candidate interventions for more sustainable ecologies and improved public health that would be impossible or unethical to test experimentally.

My [blog](blog.qmd) collects RUCA-relevant research notes, thoughts, and tutorials. Please also see the select works below that outline my contributions to a rigorous understanding of collective adaptation, or my [CV](static/turner_cv.pdf), to learn more.

### Previous experience

I received my PhD in Cognitive and Information Sciences from the University of California, Merced. Before my PhD work, I received an MS in Applied Physics from Rice University and then worked professionally as a data engineer and lead research software developer in Moscow, Idaho.
