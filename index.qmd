### Pursuing a rigorous understanding of collective adaptation {#labname}

I work to contribute to the emerging science of understanding how populations of individuals collectively adapt to their social and physical environment through exploratory learning, social influence, and evolution. Wise collective adaptation is essential for mitigating risk of disaster caused by climate change, global pandemics, or other threats. I develop mechanistic models of how collective adaptation in society emerges from individual- and group-level behavior. Mechanistic models can be used to computationally test the logic of potential hypotheses about how collective adaptation emerges, or to explain emergent collective adaptation in empirical data. What we learn from this can be combined to form a **r**igorous **u**nderstanding of **c**ollective **a**daptation. This rigorous understanding can be used to design wiser collective action. To learn more, please see some of my primary works below.My blog collects research notes and tutorials on how I contribute to ([the RUCA Blog](blog.qmd)). My [CV](static/turner_cv.pdf) contains more about me.

### Current role

I am currently a [Pandemic Preparedness Postdoctoral Scholar](https://pandemichub.stanford.edu/fellows/) working in [James Holland Jones' Human Evolutionary Ecology and Health](https://heeh.stanford.edu/about/james-holland-jones) group in the Social Sciences Division of the Stanford Doerr School of Sustainability at Stanford University. Before I received my PhD in Cognitive and Information Sciences from the University of California, Merced, I received an MS in Applied Physics from Rice University and worked professionally as a data engineer and lead research software developer.
