# Matthew Adam Turner, PhD
### Computational social scientist
## A rigorous understanding of collective adaptation {#labname}

Hello and welcome! I am currently a Pandemic Preparedness Postdoctoral Scholar working in [James Holland Jones' Human Evolutionary Ecology and Health](https://heeh.stanford.edu/about/james-holland-jones) group in the Social Sciences Division of the Stanford Doerr School of Sustainability at Stanford University. 

I received my PhD in Cognitive and Information Sciences from the University of California, Merced. I have an MS degree in Applied Physics from Rice University, and a dual BS degree in Mathematics and Physics from Syracuse University. I worked professionally in Moscow, Idaho, as a data engineer at an economic modeling firm and then as a lead research software developer at the University of Idaho working on a tristate (Idaho, Nevada, New Mexico) model- and data-intensive hydrology project.
