    "text": "Collective adaptation is the phenomenon where individuals in a population change or evolve in such a way that characteristics of the entire population change with the goal of increased fitness, which could mean increased survival, happiness, resources, or similar things that could be perceived as good (Galesic et al. 2023). This definition is abstract by design, since collective action could occur in human, non-human animal, simple or single-cell organism, or virus populations. Changes are not always beneficial, however, such as if myopic increases in consumption in times of temporary surplus lead to overconsumption and long-term decline. Humans are unique in our ability to develop and evolve cultural adaptations that can facilitate adaptation much more rapidly than genetic evolution can. However, our capacity for culture, and the cognitive social learning capacities that enable culture, evolved genetically, including conversational turn-taking, joint attention, and predictive processing which can be used for social or asocial, trial-and-error learning.\nThese blog posts explore what components, mechanisms and resulting processes underlie collective adaptation. These posts also explore how to advance the theory of collective adaptation through mechanistic modeling via agent-based or other approaches."

    "text": "What is a rigorous understanding of collective adaptation and why do we need it?\nOur current epoch is characterized by threats of climate change, ecosystem loss, pandemics, and malicious use of artificial intelligence and associated technologies. In response, we humans are challenged to collectively develop adaptations that mitigate or prevent greater catastrophe [@PisorLansingMagargal2023,@Currie2024]. Collective adaptation is an emergent phenomena composed of constituent sub-processes occurring across several time, population, and geographic/spatial scales: from milliseconds to millenia; from an individual to dyads to the global metapopulation; and from micrometers-long neurons to global-scale communication networks [@GalesicEtAl2023].\n\n\nA rigorous understanding of collective adaptation via mechanistic modeling\nMechanistic models are useful for emergent phenomena such as collective adaptation because they force experimenters to explicitly state what parts of their system of interest. A study of the development of useful mechanistic models reveals that models must be properly shielded in a way that makes empirical sense."
