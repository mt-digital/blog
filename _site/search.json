    "text": "Collective adaptation is the phenomenon where individuals in a population change or evolve in such a way that characteristics of the entire population change with the goal of increased fitness, which could mean increased survival, happiness, resources, or similar things that could be perceived as good (Galesic et al. 2023). This definition is abstract by design, since collective action could occur in human, non-human animal, simple or single-cell organism, or virus populations. Changes are not always beneficial, however, such as if myopic increases in consumption in times of temporary surplus lead to overconsumption and long-term decline. Humans are unique in our ability to develop and evolve cultural adaptations that can facilitate adaptation much more rapidly than genetic evolution can. However, our capacity for culture, and the cognitive social learning capacities that enable culture, evolved genetically, including conversational turn-taking, joint attention, and predictive processing which can be used for social or asocial, trial-and-error learning. Humans are not the only ones adapting, as animals adapt their behavior to human collective behavior (Sullivan, Bird, and Perry 2017) and pathogen spread and evolution responds to social networks (Best et al. 2011) and social behavior (Arthur et al. 2017, 2021).\nThese blog posts explore what components, mechanisms and resulting processes underlie collective adaptation. These posts also explore how to advance the theory of collective adaptation through mechanistic modeling via agent-based or other approaches."

    "text": "Our world faces threats of climate change, ecosystem loss, pandemics, political and social instability, and more. We humans are challenged to respond with adaptations that mitigate or prevent greater catastrophe (Pisor, Lansing, and Magargal 2023; Currie et al. 2024). Collective adaptation is an emergent phenomena composed of constituent sub-processes occurring across several time, population, and geographic/spatial scales: from milliseconds to millenia; from an individual to dyads to the global metapopulation; and from micrometers-long neurons to global-scale communication networks (Galesic et al. 2023). If we can develop a rigorous understanding of how collective adaptation works, we may be better able Optimal “stewardship of global collective behavior” (Bak-Coleman et al. 2021) needs a scientific, rigorus understanding of collective adaptation.\nNon-human populations, from viruses to whales, also co-adapt and co-evolve. Pathogen evolution is important cases due to the risk of disease outbreaks when pathogens spill over from non-human animals (e.g., birds, bats, pigs) to humans. Spillovers are increasingly common in the new epoch of rapid global change (Baker et al. 2022). In spillovers, pathogens are initially poorly adapted to their new human hosts, but can rescue themselves through evolution (Visher et al. 2021). Pathogen evolution is sensitive to metapopulation group structure (Best et al. 2011), and therefore pathogen evolution may be sensitive to changes in human group size, asymmetric homophily levels, out-group aversion, and rising extremism and polarization. If we could predict which groups are most likely to get infected, and which individuals are best to target for intervention towards pandemic preparedness behaviors (such as getting vaccinated), we could more efficiently use available resources.\nBeyond applications to critical problems, collective adaptation theory can be used to better understand culture in other species, for example whales who collectively generate, through transmission and modulation, a cumulative cultural repertoire of whale songs (Garland, Garrigue, and Noad 2022)."

Pathogen evolution is important cases due to the risk of disease outbreaks when pathogens spill over from non-human animals (e.g., birds, bats, pigs) to humans. Spillovers are increasingly common in the new epoch of rapid global change (Baker et al. 2022). In spillovers, pathogens are initially poorly adapted to their new human hosts, but can rescue themselves through evolution (Visher et al. 2021). Pathogen evolution is sensitive to metapopulation group structure (Best et al. 2011), and therefore pathogen evolution may be sensitive to changes in human group size, asymmetric homophily levels, out-group aversion, and rising extremism and polarization. If we could predict which groups are most likely to get infected, and which individuals are best to target for intervention towards pandemic preparedness behaviors (such as getting vaccinated), we could more efficiently use available resources.\nBeyond applications to critical problems, collective adaptation theory can be used to better understand culture in other species, for example whales who collectively generate, through transmission and modulation, a cumulative cultural repertoire of whale songs (Garland, Garrigue, and Noad 2022)."

This is known as mechanistic modeling (Matthew Adam Turner and Smaldino 2022). Mechanistic models are useful for emergent phenomena such as collective adaptation because they force experimenters to explicitly state what are the component parts of their system of interest (Kauffman 1970) and how do they interact to produce some process composed of numerous such interactions (Craver 2006). My work develops mechanistic models that synthesize, connect, and clarify diverse adaptive and social processes and understand the sometimes unexpected consequences of the interaction of these processes and the environment (Matthew Adam Turner and Smaldino 2018; Matthew A. Turner and Smaldino 2020; Matthew A. Turner et al. 2023a; Matthew A. Turner et al. 2023b)."

I will soon develop and teach undergraduate and graduate courses in computational social science for sustainability as a Lecturer, beginning November 2024 at the Stanford Doerr School of Sustainability. I direct the Rigorous Understanding of Collective Adaptation (RUCA) project, explained below.\n\n\n\nClimate disaster mitigation and pandemic preparedness need a science of collective adaptation to make wise policy. To meet this need, the rigorous understanding of collective adaptation (RUCA) project studies how populations of individuals collectively adapt to their social and physical environment through exploratory learning, social influence, and evolution. The RUCA project develops mechanistic models of how collective adaptation emerges from repeated social interactions within social networks and variable, uncertain environments. Computational mechanistic models allow us to analyze and predict the efficacy of candidate interventions for more sustainable ecologies and improved public health that would be impossible or unethical to test experimentally.\nMy blog collects RUCA-relevant research notes, thoughts, and tutorials.

GO SHORT WITH SENTENCES AND PARAGRAPHS IN BLOG)\nWhat do innovation in an online puzzle game (Derex and Boyd 2016; Moser and Smaldino 2023), health and weight loss interventions (Centola 2010a, 2011; Zhang and Centola 2019), the diffusion of climate change adaptations (Jones, Ready, and Pisor 2021; Matthew A. Turner et al. 2023), and political polarization (Flache and Macy 2011; Matthew A. Turner and Smaldino 2018) have in common? In all these cases, certain social networks enable more effective development and dissemination of collective intelligence (Centola 2022), potentially enabling more effective cultural adaptation (Galesic et al. 2023), but also sometimes amplifying problematic cultural phenomenon like polarization (Flache and Macy 2011; Matthew A. Turner and Smaldino 2018).\n\n\nIn my current project to understand the diffusion of innovations in minority-majority metapopulations, I use group-level homophily to define social network structure, where homophily is the tendency of individuals from one group to interact more frequently within their own group compared to the out-group. There seems to be no definitive way to quantify homophily, so I chose one that made the most sense to me. There are many types of homophily that may be important, as well, which I review here.\nAn alternative to homophily for defining social network structure is to focus on the degree to which a social network has a core-periphery structure, hypothesized to be critical for effective climate change adaptation (Jones, Ready, and Pisor 2021) and\n\n\n\nSee (Kossinets and Watts 2009; Centola 2010b, 2011) for some modern model and empirical foundations.

There is a difference between different measures of homophily and different forms of homophily: Kossinets & Watts also define homophily arising more from preference and those arising more from circumstance (work/profession, neighborhood, etc.), but of course a certain profession or neighborhood may be correlated with other potential group markers such as race or ethnicity.\n\nKossinets and Watts (2009)\nCentola (2011)\nMatthew A.
