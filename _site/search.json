    "text": "Collective adaptation is the phenomenon where individuals in a population change or evolve in such a way that characteristics of the entire population change with the goal of increased fitness, which could mean increased survival, happiness, resources, or similar things that could be perceived as good (Galesic et al. 2023). This definition is abstract by design, since collective action could occur in human, non-human animal, simple or single-cell organism, or virus populations. Changes are not always beneficial, however, such as if myopic increases in consumption in times of temporary surplus lead to overconsumption and long-term decline. Humans are unique in our ability to develop and evolve cultural adaptations that can facilitate adaptation much more rapidly than genetic evolution can. However, our capacity for culture, and the cognitive social learning capacities that enable culture, evolved genetically, including conversational turn-taking, joint attention, and predictive processing which can be used for social or asocial, trial-and-error learning. Humans are not the only ones adapting, as animals adapt their behavior to human collective behavior (Sullivan, Bird, and Perry 2017) and pathogen spread and evolution responds to social networks (Best et al. 2011) and social behavior (Arthur et al. 2017, 2021).\nThese blog posts explore what components, mechanisms and resulting processes underlie collective adaptation. These posts also explore how to advance the theory of collective adaptation through mechanistic modeling via agent-based or other approaches."

    "text": "Our world faces threats of climate change, ecosystem loss, pandemics, political and social instability, and more. We humans are challenged to respond with adaptations that mitigate or prevent greater catastrophe (Pisor, Lansing, and Magargal 2023; Currie et al. 2024). Collective adaptation is an emergent phenomena composed of constituent sub-processes occurring across several time, population, and geographic/spatial scales: from milliseconds to millenia; from an individual to dyads to the global metapopulation; and from micrometers-long neurons to global-scale communication networks (Galesic et al. 2023). If we can develop a rigorous understanding of how collective adaptation works, we may be better able Optimal “stewardship of global collective behavior” (Bak-Coleman et al. 2021) needs a scientific, rigorus understanding of collective adaptation.\nNon-human populations, from viruses to whales, also co-adapt and co-evolve. Pathogen evolution is important cases due to the risk of disease outbreaks when pathogens spill over from non-human animals (e.g., birds, bats, pigs) to humans. Spillovers are increasingly common in the new epoch of rapid global change (Baker et al. 2022). In spillovers, pathogens are initially poorly adapted to their new human hosts, but can rescue themselves through evolution (Visher et al. 2021). Pathogen evolution is sensitive to metapopulation group structure (Best et al. 2011), and therefore pathogen evolution may be sensitive to changes in human group size, asymmetric homophily levels, out-group aversion, and rising extremism and polarization. If we could predict which groups are most likely to get infected, and which individuals are best to target for intervention towards pandemic preparedness behaviors (such as getting vaccinated), we could more efficiently use available resources.\nBeyond applications to critical problems, collective adaptation theory can be used to better understand culture in other species, for example whales who collectively generate, through transmission and modulation, a cumulative cultural repertoire of whale songs (Garland, Garrigue, and Noad 2022)."

In spillovers, pathogens are initially poorly adapted to their new human hosts, but can rescue themselves through evolution (Visher et al. 2021). Pathogen evolution is sensitive to metapopulation group structure (Best et al. 2011), and therefore pathogen evolution may be sensitive to changes in human group size, asymmetric homophily levels, out-group aversion, and rising extremism and polarization. If we could predict which groups are most likely to get infected, and which individuals are best to target for intervention towards pandemic preparedness behaviors (such as getting vaccinated), we could more efficiently use available resources.\nBeyond applications to critical problems, collective adaptation theory can be used to better understand culture in other species, for example whales who collectively generate, through transmission and modulation, a cumulative cultural repertoire of whale songs (Garland, Garrigue, and Noad 2022)."

Mechanistic models are useful for emergent phenomena such as collective adaptation because they force experimenters to explicitly state what are the component parts of their system of interest (Kauffman 1970) and how do they interact to produce some process composed of numerous such interactions (Craver 2006). My work develops mechanistic models that synthesize, connect, and clarify diverse adaptive and social processes and understand the sometimes unexpected consequences of the interaction of these processes and the environment (Matthew Adam Turner and Smaldino 2018; Matthew A.

I direct the Rigorous Understanding of Collective Adaptation (RUCA) project, explained below.\n\n\n\nClimate disaster mitigation and pandemic preparedness need a science of collective adaptation to make wise policy. To meet this need, the rigorous understanding of collective adaptation (RUCA) project studies how populations of individuals collectively adapt to their social and physical environment through exploratory learning, social influence, and evolution. The RUCA project develops mechanistic models of how collective adaptation emerges from repeated social interactions within social networks and variable, uncertain environments. Computational mechanistic models allow us to analyze and predict the efficacy of candidate interventions for more sustainable ecologies and improved public health that would be impossible or unethical to test experimentally.\nMy blog collects RUCA-relevant research notes, thoughts, and tutorials.

    "text": "Overview\nOn November 1 I began officially as a Lecturer in the Stanford Doerr School of Sustainability at Stanford University. I am developing two courses. The first, starting January 1 next year, is Computational Social Science for Sustainability. The second is Agent-based modeling. So far I have a syllabus for Computational Social Science. I have plans for programming problem sets, lecture material, and I’m excited to see what students pursue for their cumulative midterm and final projects.\nI was hired to create a course that teaches the theory and techniques of computational social science to support sustainability with minimum technical and theoretical overhead. That means strategic choices of subject matter, and how it should be presented. Personally I think it is fun and valuable to remix and resample standard ways of introducing material. In this spirit, social interactions will be introduced as occurring in the substrate of social networks. From the first problem set, students will learn to construct, manipulate, and visualize social networks. We will spend the ten-week course studying complementary approaches to developing mechanistic models of emergent social phenomena from repeated social interactions over time. Emergent social phenomena include, for example, viral adoption of sustainable behaviors, political polarization, and sustainable groundwater management and irrigation, or management of other common-pool resources.\nWe identify and model three types of social interaction: social learning, social influence, and cooperation. Social interactions of interest may include one or more of these types of interaction. See the course syllabus for more details on specific theoretical components of social science I plan to use to model social learning, social influence, and cooperation. Broadly, social learning is informed by cultural evolutionary studies, social influence is framed in terms of opinion dynamics studies, and cooperation is based on evolutionary game theory as its starting point. Social phenomena and constituent psychological and cognitive processes\n\n\nThe course: rigorous, computer-literate social science for sustainability\nSustainability, and similar challenges like pandemic preparedness and prevention, require behavioral science to promote better outcomes. This need provides a selection pressure towards a trim presentation of social science essentials. Computation is essential for social science because we can build simulated groups and societies to perform computational experiments that would be difficult or impossible to perform in the real world. Nonetheless, these simulations can demonstrate fundamental truths in model systems with clear implications for the real world. For example, we can understand exactly how well information percolates through different model social networks, so that we may predict how many people must learn about some sustainable behavior in order for the behavior to go viral, i.e., spread widely to all members of a society.\nSocial science is one branch of behavioral science, complemented and informed by psychological and cognitive sciences and linguistics. These fields, in various ways, exist to understand how language works and how individuals are influenced differently by different communication strategies. The goal of social science here is to understand how repeated social interactions aggregate into emergent society-scale outcomes. For example, the emergent outcome of how many farmers adopt more carbon-friendly agricultural practices depends on a series of interactions with others such as learning from crop advisers and hearing the opinions of fellow farmers. Computational social science provides theoretical and modeling tools for representing repeated social interactions structured by social networks. Computational social science adds to its knowledge base with new analyses of social simulations based on empirically-motivated assumptions about social interactions work, structured by social networks and subject to uncertainty and stochasticity. Computational social science also produces new knowledge through statistical analysis of empirical data made rigorous by thoroughly accounting for sources of variance. In summary, this course will enable students to create their own analyses of societal change to contribute to a scientific understanding of how to scale up adoption of sustainable practices.\nMany students are attracted to sustainability because they care about the planet and its inhabitants. We would do well to welcome and expect sustainability students to have a spectrum of programming experience and interest. To this end, I have begun developing an R library, socmod that will pull together essential computational social science tools, models, and data. The skills students will gain in R are highly transferable. R use is widespread, I belive thanks to the stylish leadership of Hadley Wickham and associates. We will use R Shiny and tidyverse functionality including dplyr and ggplot for analyzing and visualizing model outcomes. I plan to follow the approach of Agents.jl in the functional approach to defining agent-agent interactions and model dynamics for each step, which are then scheduled and run by library code.\nThis approach to modeling will require the combination of several tools. First, object-oriented programming is most sensible for agent-based models, which will be a primary modeling method. Oftentimes a model, agent-based or otherwise, will need to be run several times over several parameter settings. This quite naturally suggests that Models, too, should be objects. Because R by default assigns by value instead of by reference, and because R is traditionally functional and declarative more than procedural, explicit object-oriented coding is relatively rare. For object-oriented programming I have chosen the R6 package, based on advice from Hadley Wickham’s book, Advanced R. In Chapter 14 on R6, Wickham notes that R6 “uses the encapsulated OOP paradigm, which means that” you call methods using the infix $ operator, calling “them like object$method()”.\nIt is possible to maintain information about simulated individuals in tabular format, as Acerbi, Mesoudi, and Smolla (2022) did wonderfully in their R-based approach to agent-based modeling (they call it individual-based, but they are identical). However a more declarative, object-oriented approach is easier for beginners, as testified to by the choice in Smaldino (2023) to use NetLogo. NetLogo is highly idiosyncratic, used almost exclusively for pedagogical purposes, and so may have relatively little transferrable value in terms of programming experience. However, there is nothing currently available that makes agent-based computational social science modeling more accessible. If the software library associated with this course succeeds, it may be accessible, help students learn transferrable skills in R and object-oriented programming, and grow into a powerful research tool for computational social science in R.\nIn making any sort of publicly-available library it’s necessary to make it easy to install and especially for students. It would be a waste of time to rush and accumulate technical debt like poorly-documented code or making code excessively difficult to install. Therefore, I am pursuing a document-driven development approach, where one of the documents are the problem sets themselves. I am using pkgdown for library documentation, and devtools for package development and distribution.\n\n\nConclusion\nWhile discussing the course Computational Social Science for Sustainability with the practicum and curriculum manager for a master’s program in the Doerr School of Sustainability, she asked me if the course should be categorized as a science course or an arts course. I briskly replied, “Science.” I understand and deeply sympathize with the question, even though to me the answer is obvious. The confusion may come from the fact that when grade school students study “social science” in the United States, it is really just “history”, maybe with some political science and civics. Furthermore, I am aware that some sociologists and anthropologists, for example, are uncomfortable with a “science” of human behavior because of historical connections with colonialism or colonial powers, and possibly due to implications that humans lack free will. It seems my job is to make it obvious to my audience that Computational social science for sustainability is unmistakeably science just like physics, chemistry, or biology. I believe this science can help steward collective behavior (Bak-Coleman et al. 2021) for a more sustainable world, which to me seems humanitarian enough to overcome potential concerns.\nMore updates will follow as I create problem sets and continue writing course notes and build the socmod R library to accelerate student learning.\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nAcerbi, Alberto, Alex Mesoudi, and Marco Smolla. 2022.
