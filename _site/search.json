    "text": "Collective adaptation is the phenomenon where individuals in a population change or evolve in such a way that characteristics of the entire population change with the goal of increased fitness, which could mean increased survival, happiness, resources, or similar things that could be perceived as good (Galesic et al. 2023). This definition is abstract by design, since collective action could occur in human, non-human animal, simple or single-cell organism, or virus populations. Changes are not always beneficial, however, such as if myopic increases in consumption in times of temporary surplus lead to overconsumption and long-term decline. Humans are unique in our ability to develop and evolve cultural adaptations that can facilitate adaptation much more rapidly than genetic evolution can. However, our capacity for culture, and the cognitive social learning capacities that enable culture, evolved genetically, including conversational turn-taking, joint attention, and predictive processing which can be used for social or asocial, trial-and-error learning. Humans are not the only ones adapting, as animals adapt their behavior to human collective behavior and pathogen\nThese blog posts explore what components, mechanisms and resulting processes underlie collective adaptation. These posts also explore how to advance the theory of collective adaptation through mechanistic modeling via agent-based or other approaches."

    "text": "Our current epoch is characterized by threats of climate change, ecosystem loss, pandemics, political and social instability, and more. In response, we humans are challenged to collectively develop adaptations that mitigate or prevent greater catastrophe (Pisor, Lansing, and Magargal 2023; Currie et al. 2024). Collective adaptation is an emergent phenomena composed of constituent sub-processes occurring across several time, population, and geographic/spatial scales: from milliseconds to millenia; from an individual to dyads to the global metapopulation; and from micrometers-long neurons to global-scale communication networks (Galesic et al. 2023). If we can develop a rigorous understanding of how collective adaptation works, we may be better able to optimize “stewardship of global collective behavior” (Bak-Coleman et al. 2021) using social science.\nNon-human populations, from viruses to whales, also co-adapt and co-evolve. Pathogen evolution is important cases due to the risk of disease outbreaks when pathogens spill over from non-human animals (e.g., birds, bats, pigs) to humans. Spillovers are increasingly common in the new epoch of rapid global change (Baker et al. 2022). In spillovers, pathogens are initially poorly adapted to their new human hosts, but can rescue themselves through evolution (Visher et al. 2021). Pathogen evolution is sensitive to metapopulation group structure (Best et al. 2011), and therefore pathogen evolution may be sensitive to changes in human group size, asymmetric homophily levels, out-group aversion, and rising extremism and polarization. If we can predict which groups are most likely to get infected, and which individuals are best to target for intervention towards pandemic preparedness behaviors (such as getting vaccinated), we could more efficiently use available resources. In addition to such practical applications of studying collective adaptation, we can better understand what we share with other species such as whales, who collectively generate a cumulative cultural repertoire of whale songs possibly used for courtship (Garland, Garrigue, and Noad 2022)."

    "text": "How to contribute to a rigorous understanding of collective adaptation?\nRigor takes time. To promote rigor is to promote a stepwise approach to building up an understanding of which parts of a system interact, and how, to cause the emergence of higher-order processes constituted by those interactions. This approach can be called mechanistic modeling. Mechanistic models are useful for emergent phenomena such as collective adaptation because they force experimenters to explicitly state what are the component parts of their system of interest (Kauffman 1970) and how do they interact to produce some process composed of numerous such interactions (Craver 2006)."

    "text": "My contributions to the rigorous understanding of collective adaptation\nMy work centers on developing mechanistic models that synthesize and clarify potentially diverse modeling assumptions and understand the sometimes unexpected consequences of model assumptions (Turner and Smaldino 2022). I am in the process of theoretically connecting different strands of work in my research program—in fact one reason this blog exists is to motivate me to develop theoretical connections between my recent work and provide a platform for publishing the first draft versions of this theoretical map. (Turner, Singleton, et al. 2023) on diffusion of adaptations in metapopulations with asymmetric group-level homophily; but how would different forms of ecological uncertainty in predicting behavioral payoffs (Turner, Moya, et al. 2023) affect the diffusion of adaptive behaviors? What about when individuals can share and disagree about beliefs or opinions, in addition to influencing one another’s behavioral knowledge through social learning? We know that initial beliefs, miscommunication, and random chance increase extremism and polarization to different degrees in different network structures (Turner and Smaldino 2018). This may drive individuals to become more entrenched in their beliefs, which may pull politically centrist individuals into more extreme opinions (Turner and Smaldino 2020).\nFor my work on pandemic preparedness, I need this nascent theoretical system in order to understand how pathogens evolve in metapopulatuions with asymmetric group-level homophily that were studied in the context of adaptation diffusion in Turner, Singleton, et al. (2023)."

Jobs from home versus frontline/essential varies by cities, races (Dingel and Neiman 2020). Not sure what to do here, but I think this will be valuable.\nHomophily could be invisible or not. For instance, experimenters could put people into groups with different homophily values, but it would be invisible without group markers. Could try to have different conditions that reveal group membership to see if knowledge of group membership inhibits diffusion of adaptations.
