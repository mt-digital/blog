    "text": "Collective adaptation is the phenomenon where individuals in a population change or evolve in such a way that characteristics of the entire population change with the goal of increased fitness, which could mean increased survival, happiness, resources, or similar things that could be perceived as good (Galesic et al. 2023). This definition is abstract by design, since collective action could occur in human, non-human animal, simple or single-cell organism, or virus populations. Changes are not always beneficial, however, such as if myopic increases in consumption in times of temporary surplus lead to overconsumption and long-term decline. Humans are unique in our ability to develop and evolve cultural adaptations that can facilitate adaptation much more rapidly than genetic evolution can. However, our capacity for culture, and the cognitive social learning capacities that enable culture, evolved genetically, including conversational turn-taking, joint attention, and predictive processing which can be used for social or asocial, trial-and-error learning. Humans are not the only ones adapting, as animals adapt their behavior to human collective behavior (Sullivan, Bird, and Perry 2017) and pathogen spread and evolution responds to social networks (Best et al. 2011) and social behavior (Arthur et al. 2017, 2021).\nThese blog posts explore what components, mechanisms and resulting processes underlie collective adaptation. These posts also explore how to advance the theory of collective adaptation through mechanistic modeling via agent-based or other approaches."

    "text": "Our current epoch is characterized by threats of climate change, ecosystem loss, pandemics, political and social instability, and more. In response, we humans are challenged to collectively develop adaptations that mitigate or prevent greater catastrophe (Pisor, Lansing, and Magargal 2023; Currie et al. 2024). Collective adaptation is an emergent phenomena composed of constituent sub-processes occurring across several time, population, and geographic/spatial scales: from milliseconds to millenia; from an individual to dyads to the global metapopulation; and from micrometers-long neurons to global-scale communication networks (Galesic et al. 2023). If we can develop a rigorous understanding of how collective adaptation works, we may be better able to optimize “stewardship of global collective behavior” (Bak-Coleman et al. 2021) using social science.\nNon-human populations, from viruses to whales, also co-adapt and co-evolve. Pathogen evolution is important cases due to the risk of disease outbreaks when pathogens spill over from non-human animals (e.g., birds, bats, pigs) to humans. Spillovers are increasingly common in the new epoch of rapid global change (Baker et al. 2022). In spillovers, pathogens are initially poorly adapted to their new human hosts, but can rescue themselves through evolution (Visher et al. 2021). Pathogen evolution is sensitive to metapopulation group structure (Best et al. 2011), and therefore pathogen evolution may be sensitive to changes in human group size, asymmetric homophily levels, out-group aversion, and rising extremism and polarization. If we can predict which groups are most likely to get infected, and which individuals are best to target for intervention towards pandemic preparedness behaviors (such as getting vaccinated), we could more efficiently use available resources. In addition to such practical applications of studying collective adaptation, we can better understand what we share with other species such as whales, who collectively generate a cumulative cultural repertoire of whale songs possibly used for courtship (Garland, Garrigue, and Noad 2022)."

    "text": "How to contribute to a rigorous understanding of collective adaptation?\nRigor takes time. To promote rigor is to promote a stepwise approach to building up an understanding of which parts of a system interact, and how, to cause the emergence of higher-order processes constituted by those interactions. This approach can be called mechanistic modeling. Mechanistic models are useful for emergent phenomena such as collective adaptation because they force experimenters to explicitly state what are the component parts of their system of interest (Kauffman 1970) and how do they interact to produce some process composed of numerous such interactions (Craver 2006)."

I am in the process of theoretically connecting different strands of work in my research program—in fact one reason this blog exists is to motivate me to develop theoretical connections between my recent work and provide a platform for publishing the first draft versions of this theoretical map. (Turner, Singleton, et al. 2023) on diffusion of adaptations in metapopulations with asymmetric group-level homophily; but how would different forms of ecological uncertainty in predicting behavioral payoffs (Turner, Moya, et al. 2023) affect the diffusion of adaptive behaviors? What about when individuals can share and disagree about beliefs or opinions, in addition to influencing one another’s behavioral knowledge through social learning? We know that initial beliefs, miscommunication, and random chance increase extremism and polarization to different degrees in different network structures (Turner and Smaldino 2018). This may drive individuals to become more entrenched in their beliefs, which may pull politically centrist individuals into more extreme opinions (Turner and Smaldino 2020).\nFor my work on pandemic preparedness, I need this nascent theoretical system in order to understand how pathogens evolve in metapopulatuions with asymmetric group-level homophily that were studied in the context of adaptation diffusion in Turner, Singleton, et al. (2023)."

    "section": "",
    "text": "I think of myself as a theoretical social scientist, in the same sense as a theoretical physicist, chemist, or biologist. Unfortunately that does not seem to be a title that social scientists use or recognize. Other major scientific fields separate theoretical and empirical practitioners, including biology, chemistry and physics. If a biologist, let’s say, primarily develops and analyzes simplified, abstract models of biological phenomena, they would probably be called a theoretical biologist (or perhaps mathematical biologist). Same if we replace biologist with physicist or chemist. Theoretical scientists try to explain wide varieties of scientific results with minimal assumptions, a quality called parsimony. A more parsimonious theory explains more empirical phenomena with fewer assumptions. The job of theoretical scientists is to increase the parsimony of their field’s theories, fostering synergy between new theoretical and empirical work and attempting to avoid fractured foundational knowledge. I want to take a few paragraphs to understand how this works in social science and to answer, what, exactly, is the job of a theoretical social scientist?\nTheoretical specialists can help ensure that social science research is motivated by mechanistic models that are both logically self-consistent and consistent with accepted theory. Mechanistic models of social behavior specify the capacities that model agents have and how they interact with one another and their environment. Capacities and interaction tend to be specified in terms of parameters, e.g., a parameter that says how likely an agent is to learn from someone else at a certain time step. This combination of parameterized capacities and interactions that results in complex social behavior of interest can be represented by a set of equations that simulates certain model dynamics, or implemented as a generative simulation. Simulations can be run over model parameters for furthermore that yield clear predictions generated through the simulation machine defined by the mechanistic model. This will help avoid over-generalization of empirical results that can occur when non-mechanistic verbal descriptions of previous correlations theoretically motivate the research (Yarkoni 2022). To make models most useful for predicting real-world outcomes, theorists must be able to justify and unpack modeling choices. For example, if one adopts a model of cultural evolution, one must define “mutation” and explain how cultural “generations” relate to genetic generations for which the concept of mutation was first defined.\nCurrently, it is not clear how well I, or theoretical social science in general, is doing at providing parsimonious explanations of empirical phenomena. Oftentimes models are narrowly focused on phenomenon in a specific context or they are focused on generating phenomena that may be difficult to directly reproduce in a laboratory.\nTheoretical scientists find common cause with their empiricist colleagues in a division of labor meant to maximize the productivity of individuals and the field as a whole. Richard Feynman, an influential theoretical physicist, had a special skill for asking helpful questions of experimentalist colleagues that helped them debug experimental apparatuses that were not operating properly. Currently the social sciences seem to proceed from fractured, inharmonious theoretical foundations (Almaatouq et al. 2022). Perhaps by clearly delineating theoretical and experimental practices of social science, individuals can better develop and harness critical expertise through this division of labor. Theoretical social scientists could help, for example, engage with experimental social scientists, visit anthropological field sites, and get involved with designing experiments or fieldwork. This will help us build a sound, not fractured, theoretical foundation for a rigorous understanding of social science in general.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nAlmaatouq, Abdullah, Thomas L.
